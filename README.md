## 1.  How do I approach designing software?

I have always known that the best approach is an iterative continually refining
appraoch, however until this project I always kind of failed at this step.  This
project with its complexity, made me practice the iterative approach.  In
addition, this project also taught me the benifit of abstraction.

## 2.  How do I approach developing software?

This project definately taught me the value to the "Test early, Test often" 
philosophy.  I had always basically tried to push through the development of a
program and finish as much as possible prior to building and testing.  With this
project I had to take a step back, and add a feature and then build and test.  Rinse
wash repeat.

## 3.  How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This question definately hits home to me because computer science is my goal.  I 
had a computer as a kid.  Before a "PC" was a thing, my parents bought a Radio
Shack TRS-80 computer.  I would spend hours on it playing around with BASIC Programming.
I would get a BASIC book, and type in the programs listed in the book.  Fast 
forward a bunch of years, my freshman year in High School and I took a Pascal
programming class.  This class made me fall in love with computer programming and 
forever cement my goal to become a professional programmer.  31 years later and I am 
finally able to start realizing my goal.  In addition, I really think I would like
to get into the video game industry, so I think that the basic knowledge learned
in this class, in addition to the continued learning that I will definately do will
assist in realizing my secondary goal to get into video game development.
